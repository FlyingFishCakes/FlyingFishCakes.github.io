# Machine Learning in action

## Machine Learning Basics
Chapters 1-7
### Subject Of Classification
### k-Nearest Neighbors
### Decision Trees
### Probability Distributions for Classification
### Naive Bayes Algorithm
### Logistic Regression
### How to deal with missing values
### Support Vector Machines
### AdaBoost Ensemble Method
### Classification Imbalance when training examples are not evenly distributed

## Forecasting Numeric Values with Regression
Chapters 8-9
### Regression
### Shrinkage Methods
### Locally Weighted Linear Regression
### Bias-Variance Tradeoff
### Tree-Based Regression
### CART Algorithm

## Unsupervised Learning
Chapters 10-12
### Unsupervised Learning
We do not know what we are looking for; instead we ask the machine to tell us "what do these data have in common?".
### k-Means Clustering
### Association Analysis with Apriori Algorithm
### FP-Growth

## Additional Tools
Chapters 13-14
### Mathematical Operations used to Remove Noise from Data
### Principal Components Analysis
### Singular Value Decomposition
### Scale Machine learning to Massive Datasets

## Examples
Throughout the book, below is a short stab of examples I want to keep track of.
