<h3 id="quoting-home-barista-forum">Quoting Home-Barista Forum:</h3>
<p>“Double roasting” is a technique that was once used in Switzerland to create very low acid roasts. The beans are roasted to the first crack, left to cool, then reroasted until you get a color you like (no more cracks). I’ve never tried doing this, but I had the coffee when I was a kid (sort of like toddy brewed coffee). It creates a gorgeous translucent bean, so if you want to display roasted beans, this is the way to get them really pretty.</p>

<p>People on alt.coffee reported trying it, and it works. It might even work if the roast went further than first crack. However, the only reference I can find now is in Coffeesnobs</p>

<p>This was also the case for me if you reference the section “Honduras Santa Elena”, in which I re-roasted underdeveloped beans. The acidity was indeed lowered not just because of roast level and the coffee did indeed look beautifully amber, but something not mentioned in this post is that there is likely not anymore formation of gases in the second roast and so coffee is degas faster after the second roast. I will look into articles online but just from this real world example I can tell that flavor, in this case acidity, is most definitely affected differently when roasted twice instead of a single longer roast.</p>
