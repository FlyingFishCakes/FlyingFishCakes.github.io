<p>Assuming other factors are held constant.<br />
Grind: finer = higher extraction, coarser = lower extraction<br />
Dose: less = higher extraction, more = lower extraction<br />
Water Temperature: lower = lower extraction, high = higher extraction<br />
Water Weight: less = lower extraction, more = higher extraction</p>

<p><b>This is personal preference but if you find a coffee that despite dialing-in, never tastes quite right, try a different brew method. Switching between immersion (French Press, Ibrik/Cezve, Aeropress, etc.) vs percolation (Pour Over, Espresso, etc.) make a big difference sometimes. There are some dark roast coffees that I absolutely can’t stand as a pour over that I love as French Press or Turkish Coffee. </b></p>

<p>For pour over it is also important to pour slowly enough so the coffee grounds that are floating sink in order for the water to percolate through it. If you find that a lot of coffee is floating during your pour then the coffee that is floating will under extract and the coffee that is at the bottom will over extract. Percolation (bed of coffee at bottom) is stronger at dissolving coffee soluble than immersion (floating coffee on top).</p>

<h2 id="my-current-pour-over-guide-updated-regularly">My Current Pour Over Guide (Updated Regularly)</h2>
<h3 id="default---single-pour-with-2-bloom-pours-when-you-have-more-coffee-to-dial-in">Default - Single Pour with 2 Bloom Pours (when you have more coffee to dial in)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare brewer, filter, hot water, ground coffee, stir stick, scale, and optionally a timer</li>
  <li>Place filter in brewer, with stir stick to prewet and preheat brewer</li>
  <li>Put coffee in filter on top of stir stick, do kubomi bloom (you would want to grind the coffee on the finer side - think Aeropress)</li>
  <li>Add 2 times the weight of grounds of water and use Hoffman swirl or stir (the moment the water touches the coffee is when you want to start the timer)</li>
  <li>Using stir stick to agitate the entire slurry focusing on the bottom of the brewer</li>
  <li>After movement of bloom pour stops begin to pour</li>
  <li>Pour 2 times the weight of grounds again and use stir stick to break any clumps</li>
  <li>Before letting the water drain begin pouring the rest of the water</li>
  <li>Pour gently to avoid disturbing the bed of coffee and fill the brewer (you can pour on to the sides of the cone to break the fall of the water, there is no effective bypass in a non-wavy cone filter)</li>
  <li>When the water level drains until about level with the coffee bed, give the slurry a shake to even the bed and let drain (if you notice this is choking the drawdown, just leave it alone so fines don’t clog the filter) (this is when you stop the timer)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="explanation">Explanation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Kubomi bloom is just a divot in the dry bed of grounds to better allow water to penetrate the bottom of the coffee bed.</li>
  <li>Agitating the bubbles in the bloom works to saturate dry spots of grounds.</li>
  <li>The second pulse of water with agitation preps the bed of coffee to allow even percolation of water through the puck (notice that after bloom pour the wet grounds clump again?). You get a slurry with no clumps and naturally settles to the bottom assuming you did a good job with the bloom.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-to-keep-in-mind">Things to keep in mind:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you choose to swirl the bloom instead of stirring remember to not do it too many times as it has a tendency to choke the drawdown</li>
  <li>If you use a timer keep in mind it is an output variable, and can be used for diagnosing problems (otherwise not very important)</li>
  <li>Most coffees work better at the highest water temp possible. From my experience coffees light roast all the way to just beyond second crack work better with hotter water. Significantly after the second crack is when I noticed that reducing temperature produced better results (I was met with tobacco-ish notes with higher water temp).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="secondary---pulse-pour-when-you-have-less-coffee-to-dial-in">Secondary - Pulse Pour (when you have less coffee to dial in)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare brewer, filter, hot water, ground coffee, stir stick, scale, and optionally a timer</li>
  <li>Place filter in brewer to prewet and preheat brewer</li>
  <li>Put coffee in filter (you would want to grind the coffee on the coarser side - think french press)</li>
  <li>Pour 2 times the weight of the coffee and wait 30 seconds</li>
  <li>Again pour 2 times the weight of the coffee and wait 30 seconds</li>
  <li>Now divide the rest of your brew water into pulses of water (more pulses (maybe 4-5) if light roast, less pulses (maybe 2-3) if dark)</li>
  <li>Remember to keep your kettle up to temperature, and after you’re done pulsing just wait for drawdown and you’re finished</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="explanation-1">Explanation:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This pour method combines pulses pouring with a coarser grind because I found that it is easier to get a better cup with a coarse grind and high agitation (pulses from the kettle agitating in this case), check bypass brewing</li>
  <li>The reason this is not the default method is because it is more labor intensive and I usually have enough coffee to dial in on my default method (I do use this method when I am just to lazy to dial in though)</li>
  <li>The reason you want more pulses if the coffee is roasted light and less if dark is because agitation increases extraction</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-to-keep-in-mind-1">Things to keep in mind:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you are over extracting grind coarser and use less pulses</li>
  <li>If you are under extracting grind finer and use more pulses</li>
  <li>Remember to keep your kettle temp up, because with less water in the cone temperature drops faster</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="tertiary---ibrikcezve">Tertiary - Ibrik/Cezve</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Prepare Ibrik, Cezve, or saucepan with ground coffee, water, scale, stir stick, and optionally a thermometer</li>
  <li>Measure out a ratio of 1:10 to 1:8 coffee to water ratio based on preference</li>
  <li>Add coffee then water and stir just enough to incorporate ground coffee (This is when you add sugar and spices if you want)</li>
  <li>Put the vessel on the stove and bring to 70 Celsius if very dark roast or 90 Celsius for very light roast. (80 Celsius is a good starting point for everything else)</li>
  <li>If you don’t have a thermometer just finish once the coffee foams up once</li>
  <li>After bringing it up to temperature pour into your serving cup and your done!</li>
  <li>Extra: if you don’t like the sludge you can filter it with a rinsed pour over filter + cone</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="my-own-experience">My Own Experience:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This method is great with sugar making a dessert drink.</li>
  <li>Cardamom, cinnamon, cocoa powder are all things I’ve tried adding to make a spiced drink, but haven’t had any success (either plain or with sugar is best IMO)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="things-to-try">Things to try:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>filter above the coffee puck to buffer water (similar to scott rao high extraction espresso, channeling is less likely given filter grind size but what if I grind finer than recommended?)</li>
</ul>
