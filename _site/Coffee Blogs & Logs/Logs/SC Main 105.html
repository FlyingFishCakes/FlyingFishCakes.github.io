<h2 id="commercially-roasted-coffee">Commercially Roasted Coffee</h2>
<p>Bought from Walmart in a 340 gram bag.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-notes-on-4-9-2021">Tasting Notes on 4-9-2021:</h2>
<p>Mild acidity, sweet, slight roasty finish, bitter finish</p>

<p>Espresso recipe is 40 grams out, 15 grams in, 6 bar pressure, and 15 second brew time. Tastes pretty good still needs to be dialed in a bit.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-notes-on-4-10-2021">Tasting Notes on 4-10-2021:</h2>
<p>Very sweet, tart acidity, honey on the finish</p>

<p>Espresso recipe is 41 grams out, 15 grams in, 6 bar pressure, and one step coarser than yesterday. Roasty/bitter finish is gone now and the espresso is sweet with a mild acidity which is surprising. This is a medium roast so I was expecting a sharper more aggressive acidity. Either this coffee is a little more developed than I thought or it might be the effect of getting stale.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-notes-on-4-10-2021-1">Tasting Notes on 4-10-2021:</h2>
<p>Mildly Sweet, roasty/bitter, no acidity</p>

<p>30 grams in, 500 grams out, V60 pour over. This is probably over extracted, I probably need to lower the brew temp and coarsen the grind size to get rid of the roasty and bitter tastes respectively. Not great.</p>

<h2 id="tasting-notes-on-4-11-2021">Tasting Notes on 4-11-2021:</h2>
<p>Mild Sweetness, mild acidity, heavy body</p>

<p>50 grams in, 800 grams out, V60 pour over temperature dropped to 85 Celsius grind coarsened. This is properly extracted and tastes good, but is a little weak (stronger ratio would probably be better). I have run out of this coffee so I guess I won’t get another chance to dial in this time.</p>

<h2 id="review">Review</h2>
<p>This was pretty good and while it sometimes showed notes of staleness, it didn’t show any notes of oxidation.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>I am beginning to think that most commercially roasted coffees are perfectly fine to purchase given that you take proper care to store the beans after opening the bag. Most likely because it was bagged immediately after roasting in a package with a valve there was no chance for oxygen to make it into the bean. But even if there is no oxygen contacting the bean, the coffee will still off-gas over time and gas will exit through the valve. As a result the coffee is stale but not oxidized; this means you can get decent commercial coffee if you are a bit more tentative. They will oxidize much faster than a freshly roasted coffee in the same storage conditions.</p>

<p>Upon opening a larger bag of coffee separate it into no more than 1 week portions.<br />
Freeze all the bags that you are not using.<br />
Keep the bags after use for the next time you buy commercially roasted coffee.</p>
