# Ethiopian Dumerso

## Roast Date: 12-28-2020
8 oz batch before roast -> 7.3 oz batch after roast (8.75% weight loss)  
8 minute roast with DTR of 20% (declining ROR observed)  
4 minute drying phase  
6 minute first crack  
8 minute drop

### Tasting notes on 1-2-2021 (5 days after roast):
Weak, watery, off-taste, citrus after-taste, sweet, off-smell

The aforementioned off-taste smells and tastes a bit like boiled vegetables. Tasted predominantly sweet with very little acidity, most likely because it needs more time to degas it was roasted pretty light.

### Tasting notes on 1-4-2021 (7 days after roast):
Stronger than before but still tea like, acidity more pronounced reminiscent of stone fruit, off-taste and off-smell gone, very sweet

After waiting another 2 days to degas the boiled vegetable smell and taste are gone. May benefit from more time to degas (according to a published study 2-12 days may be needed to proper degas). Since this was roasted very lightly it may need a full 12 days to degas properly.

### Tasting notes on 1-6-2021 (10 days after roast):
Stronger taste, very sweet, touch of acidity, floral notes pronounced, citrus notes vague

May have to try with a paper filter because that usually increases acidity while cloth filter increases aroma of coffee. Still peach-like sweetness as a result of a combination of floral smell, sweet taste, and underlying acidity that tapers off like orange fruit juice.

### Tasting notes on 1-11-2021 (15 days after roast):
Very sweet, very strong fruit flavors, touch of acidity, super tasty

It Tasted like fruit juice compared to other coffees that I have had. It is very tasty.
