<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-4-15-2021">Tasting Notes on 4-15-2021:</h3>
<p>Sweet, molasses, mild roasty/bitter, mildest suggestion of acidity</p>

<p>Very plain, not many characteristics, tastes like the theoretical tasteless dark roast. Brewed with a V60, maybe I under extracted it? I’ll try clever dripper, french press, and ibrik next. I don’t really like dark roasts coffee without chocolate notes.</p>

<p>Very sweet, slight smoky, slight chocolate on finish, molasses</p>

<p>Brewed with french press and gives a much better taste than earlier today. It taste only slightly better, I should try brewing it as espresso because that is the last thing I can thing of. It tastes very boring, stereotypical dark roast flavors, no characteristics of note.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-4-16-2021">Tasting Notes on 4-16-2021:</h3>
<p>Very sweet, very pleasant acidity, raisin-like combination of sweetness and acidity, very mild bitterness, a bit of cocoa on the finish, very very tasty</p>

<p>Espresso recipe 15 grams in, 30 grams out, not timed. The coffee completely transforms when brewed as espresso rather than filter or french press. It is incredibly sweet with pleasant acidity and finishes of mild bitterness. The combination of sweetness and acidity is reminiscent of dried fruit - hence raisins; the bitterness takes a back seat since the sweetness compliments the acidity more and is as if there is a little bit of cocoa powder incorporated into the drink.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-4-21-2021">Tasting Notes on 4-21-2021:</h3>
<p>Very Sweet, slight hint of chocolate, notes of molasses, very mild acidity(dried fruit like), roasted nuts, very tasty</p>

<p>Brewed with a V60, I finally figured out how to dial it in. I used hottest water possible with 20 grams coffee, 200 grams water, with a very very slow pour. It is very sweet and no longer has notes of over extraction. I think from now on a 1:10 ratio is the correct recipe for dark roasts.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-4-22-2021">Tasting Notes on 4-22-2021:</h3>
<p>Very sweet, roasty notes, hint of chocolate, roasted nuts, mild acidity</p>

<p>Brewed with V60, 60 grams coffee, 600 grams water, 150 grams water added dilution. It is very sweet and tasty, but has notes of over extraction and might need a coarser grind.</p>
