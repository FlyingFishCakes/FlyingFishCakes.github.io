# Honduras Santa Elena

## Roast Date: 1-14-2021
8.01 oz before roast -> 7.1 oz after roast (11.36% weight loss)  
8:30 minute roast (declining ROR observed)  
5 minute first crack  
8:30 drop (41.18% DTR)

Bag said to roast as close to second crack as possible, if it does not taste good I will try to roast to 25% DTR with declining ROR.

### Tasting notes on 1-21-2021 (7 days after roast):
Sweet, tea like, slight vegetable on the finish, chocolate

May be under roasted. Very hard time grinding the beans, and behaved like a light roast. The beans are very dense and may need to roast hotter next time.

## Testing reroasting of beans:
160 gram before roast -> 156 gram after roast (2.5% weight loss)
4:30 roast time

It is behaving very differently after roasting. The flavor is much stronger and better tasting now, with some more notes of chocolate, but acidity has been muted. The coffee is also behaving differently in that the bloom and off-gassing is much less intense meaning that the gasses inside the bean escaped somehow, while no new gasses were formed during the second roast. It may be plausible that roasting a large batch of coffee beans very lightly before cold storage to roast small batches prior to use might be a thing you could do (I donâ€™t know why, but it is something you could do).

### Tasting notes on 1-23-2021:
Cocoa, raisins, light sweetness, low body, no floral, fruity acidity
14:15 minute roast (declining ROR)
5 minute dry phase
12 minute first crack
14:15 drop (15.79% DTR)

Bag said to roast 15 seconds after first cracks. Tasting notes on the bag said cocoa, milk,etc.
