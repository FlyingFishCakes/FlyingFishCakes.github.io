<h2 id="roast-date-1-21-2021">Roast Date: 1-21-2021</h2>
<p>8.0 oz before roast -&gt; 6.84 oz after roast (14.5% weight loss)<br />
25 minute roast with declining ROR<br />
8 minute drying phase<br />
14 minute first crack<br />
25 minute second crack<br />
25 minute drop<br />
Was supposed to bring close to second crack but because of temperature dropping during the middle of roasting, time was dragged out.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-1-30-2021">Tasting Notes on 1-30-2021:</h3>
<p>Medium body, sweet, slight molasses, slight smoky, raisins</p>

<p>Fairly indistinct medium dark roast with notes of raisins/figs with notes of molasses characteristic of a darker roast. Oddly enough no discernible notes of nuts or cocoa present in many other coffees. After taking a look at the bag I found out that I nailed the tasting notes on the head (raisin, brown sugar, fig, newton - definitely didn’t taste any). Next time I roast this I should dial it a bit light because the brown sugar/molasses notes have a slight aftertaste of tobacco indicating that it is slightly darker than I would consider ideal. May try Osmotic flow brew method to exaggerate dark roast characteristics.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-1-30-2021-1">Tasting Notes on 1-30-2021:</h3>
<p>Heavy body, sweet, molasses, slightly smoky/musky, raisins</p>

<p>This time brewed with the Osmotic flow method. The difference is subtle but present compared to yesterday. Body is a bit heavier and the taste + sweetness of the molasses is stronger, but acidity is less pronounced lowering the raisin character.</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-1-31-2021">Tasting Notes on 1-31-2021:</h3>
<p>Sweet, molasses, roasty, slight tobacco</p>

<p>Used stronger ratio, taste is slightly better. Still slight tobacco taste</p>

<h3 id="tasting-notes-on-2-1-2021">Tasting Notes on 2-1-2021:</h3>
<p>Sweet, raisins, slight molasses</p>

<p>Used a normal 60 grams per liter ratio with heavy agitation, the tobacco flavor is gone and is very sweet with molasses and raisins. Previous conception was wrong, osmotic flow is bad, either uneven extraction (caused by little agitation) or lower brew temp is bringing out the slight tobacco flavor and is making the coffee taste bad. I’m getting more confused when osmotic flow is good or if it is even good at all. The first percolation phase of the Osmotic flow method only percolates through a small amount of the grounds with the rest of the coffee above the water line and we know that percolation is stronger than immersion causing uneven extraction. Osmotic flow method might have to be modified to work better.</p>
