# Starbucks French Roast
I always have access to a bag of Starbucks French roast because it is my parents favorite coffee. It always reminds me of heavy molasses and tobacco, and if brewed perfectly you can limit the tobacco taste and is a terrific base for a milk drink. Whenever I am experimenting with different brewing methods I like to try and dial in a cup of this coffee, because it is incredibly easy to over-extract. As of now the only times I have ever made a less-offensive cup of this coffee is with a french press and clever dripper.

## Tasting Notes on 1-19-2021:
Musty, bitter, tobacco, overpowering

Brewed with the bypass brewing method to see if I could combat over extraction, but it just tastes plain bad. I wonder if this is actually under extracted since I didn’t agitate it, but it still tastes so strong for some reason.

## Tasting Notes on 1-20-2021:
Bitter, molasses, weak bodied

Brewed with a bypass method and significantly reduced the brewing temperature from boiling to 180 Fahrenheit. Still not good but less offensive, still doesn’t compare to immersion brews of this coffee.

## Tasting Notes on 3-3-2021:
Bitter, spiced, sweet, tobacco, heavy bodied, unpleasant

Brewed with an Ibrik with sugar, cardamom, nutmeg at a 1:8 ratio. Taste terrible. I think that this brew method may actually make very tasty coffe, because it changed a bad tasting coffee and made it taste palatable cut still unpleasant. I am thinking that the next time I brewed this coffee I should brew it in a french press with some spices and sugar before decanting it to make a milk drink.
