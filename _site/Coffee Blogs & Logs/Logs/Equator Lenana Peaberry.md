### Tasting Notes on 5-5-2021:
Mellow acidity, caramel, gentle sweetness, floral, very tasty

Very tasty and perfectly extracted. After waiting for it to cool the acidity and sweetness becomes much more pronounced. It tastes like fruit juice or a sweet fruit tea almost.

### Tasting Notes on 5-14-2021:
Sweet, peach/stonefruit, honey, refreshing

Still tastes like fruit juice. Same ratio but as cold coffee. Super tasty and refreshing and sweet.
