# Context is important!

Opinions are subjective, but can be useful given context so here's mine:  
* No formal or professional training of any kind, but love coffee
* I prefer drinking coffee black or in some cases with sugar, very rarely with milk.
* I love light/medium roasts of all kinds (haven't found one I didn't like after dialing in).
* Dark roasts I'm more picky about. If it doesn't have heavy chocolate notes with pleasant sweetness there's a drastically lower chance I'm interested in it

## My Coffee Gear
* V60 pour over with cloth filters

* 1zpresso JX Manual hand grinder
* Hario Mini Mill Slim
