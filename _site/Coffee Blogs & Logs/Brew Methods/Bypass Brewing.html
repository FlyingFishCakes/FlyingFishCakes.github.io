<p>This brew method is where you extract the grounds with a smaller amount of brew water to create a concentrate that is then diluted to the desired strength. There are mixed messages about whether to grind finer (James Hoffman) or coarser (Royal Coffee, Aeropress). I’m thinking that if I grind finer I just brew as normal (coned topped with high thermal mass), while if I grind coarser I might keep the slurry lower and agitate more like I would in an aeropress. Conclusion posted below after testing.</p>

<p>I recently saw a video on James Hoffman’s channel titled “Decolonising Coffee Through Flavor”. In it I saw something called a South Indian Coffee Filter in which you grind espresso/turkish fine coffee and you let it percolate slowly through a metal filter to get a concentrate. I wonder if that can be recreated with a paper filter in a V60 to get a strong coffee concentrate, and I also wonder if this would be a great time to use that metal pour over filter I never liked because of all the sediment (The coffee concentrate I saw in the video was wonderfully clear and free of sediment).</p>

      <li>Recipe is 1:17 brew ratio with ~80% of the brew water used to brew and ~20% of the water in the cup. He splits the brew water into 3 equal pulses.</li>

  <li>This is very similar to what I want to learn, but the videos are all Korean and so I can’t understand any recipes. Further, I am not a fan of the center pour that leaves a ring of grounds on the edge of the dripper</li>

  <li>These 2 videos are my best bet, but instead of adding ice I would just be adding hot water to the carafe/cup. In both videos the recipes use 60%~66% of the total water as brew water.</li>

  <li>This recipe is worded poorly so it is pretty confusing. I think it says that they started with a Kalita wave and brewed bypass using 40% brew water using a 1:18 brew ratio. Then they changed brewers to the clever dripper and tested 2 different coffees. Then they say they brewed the same concentrate using 40% brew water (on 1:18 ratio) and then added a ratio of water based on the resulting concentrate. This means that the 20%-40% water they add is referring to a percentage of the brewed concentrate weight. This results in a small amount of coffee drink at the end which they note so I’m not really eager to test this method.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <s> Having dialed in a few brews with a 1:10 ratio using a V60 which I then dilute after to taste, I have come up with some conclusions. This is not a very efficient brewing method usually resulting in a stronger coffee that can be diluted but is most likely lower in terms of total extraction from the ground coffee. This is effective if you are combatting over extraction this would be a more drastic measure to take.</s>
  </li>
  <li>I changed my mind. This is a wonderful way to make coffee and the method is actually the Aeropress way. Grind coarse, pulse pour, agitate like mad, let it slowly drawdown and you end up with a strong perfectly extracted coffee concentrate. I used a 1:10 ratio dividing each pulse pour into 2.5 times the water 4 times (I’m not quite sure what the optimal pulse pour amounts would be). After each pulse of water I agitate ~10 times  give or take with a spoon. After the coffee has drawn down I add enough water to finish with a 1:15 ratio (this is just a personal preference). After finding out this method of making a coffee concentrate I can say that I will definitely change the traditional way I make Japanese Iced Coffee.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="main-takeaways">Main Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is an effective but less efficient way to combat over extraction, but this makes me curious about whether I could make certain dark roasted coffees taste amazing.</li>
  <li>Aeropress method is the way to go</li>
  <li>Grind coarser (about 2-3 numbers (6-9 clicks) back on the 1zpresso JX from the dialed in setting, probably more if it is a darker roast) remember that you are brewing at a much stronger ratio  so you don’t need to too much coarser since the stronger ratio will also combat over-extraction</li>
  <li>Agitate plenty (how much you agitate is likely a factor to change given different roast levels)
Pulse pour to keep slurry level low and drawdown slow<br />
Body of coffee is reduced for some reason, probably just a side effect of dilution afterwards and not passing that water through the coffee bed.</li>
</ul>
