# Chanho Tornado
Needs some practice to get that signature dome at the end. I needed to grind a bit finer since it has a faster drawdown allowing a finer grind to allow for enough extraction. Because the coffee is swirling around in the cone, it only initially filters through a small portion of the grounds making the drawdown start fast and stay fast until near the very end.

## Main Takeaways
* Heavy agitation helps extraction
* The faster the drawdown the finer you can grind
* The finer you grind the faster you extract
* This is only practical on a single cup or small brew
