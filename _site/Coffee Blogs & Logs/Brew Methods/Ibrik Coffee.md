# Ibrik/Cezve/MÄ±rra Coffee
It is incredibly tasting after dialing in the brew method. I can see where the reputation of it being heavily spiced and sugar-ed comes from because of how easy it is to over-extract given the flour fine grind and how many people compensate for that. The guides I found below helped me out a lot in dialing in.

## Recipe
* Ratio is 1:8 - 1:10 coffee to water with optional sugar and spices
* Room temp or cold water into the Ibrik with coffee and optionally sugar and spices
* Stir to incorporate coffee with water (no more than ~10 times)
* Heat Ibrik over medium heat swirling very occasionally if you see coffee float or look uneven
* Let it slowly rise once
* Pick up Ibrik and let the foam deflate a bit before safely pouring into serving cup
* Alternatively, you can pour through a pour over filter to remove sediment getting a clean strong cup

## Tips & Takeaways
* The coffee will absorb roughly 1.5 ~ 2.0 times the water weight leaving a sludge at the bottom
* I find that 1:10 works well for lighter roasts, while 1:8 works better for darker roasts (1:10 gives a lighter cleaner cup, 1:8 gives a heavier richer cup)
* Adding sugar will increase body/thickness on top of sweetness (1:8 ratio dark roast with a spoon of sugar is like a dessert)
* If you want the crema on top then remember coffee freshness is your friend
* The crema you see on top of the coffee adds bitterness, but makes your coffee much more aromatic, if you want to get rid of the roast-y bitterness you can skim off the crema for a sweeter tasting cup.
* If your coffee is going stale/has off flavors this brew method will most likely exacerbate it.
* You can filter your coffee if you don't like the sediment just by pouring it through a filter after the coffee is done.
