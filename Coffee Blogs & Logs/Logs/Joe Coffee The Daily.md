# Joe Coffee: The Daily

## Source
Cometeer Coffee Capsule.
Package Tasting Notes: Chocolate, molasses,


### Tasting Notes on 5-5-2021:
Very sweet, dried fruit like acidity, cocoa, heavier body

Very tasty, diluted with 8 oz water. The acidity is mild and is reminiscent of dried fruit and is very mild (think the after taste of dried figs).

### Tasting Notes on 5-12-2021:
Sweet, raisins, molasses

Not getting an cocoa or chocolate today for some reason even though I'm pretty sure it both of these capsules are from the same batch of brewed coffee. Probably just day to day differences with myself.
