### Tasting Notes on 5-6-2021:
Very sweet, mellow acidity, medium body, stone fruit-like acidity, caramel aftertaste in sweetness

Very tasty, perfectly extracted. Tastes kind of one-note after drinking African coffees with floral qualities, but is still a great cup of coffee. I would have thought it was extremely tasty instead of just very tasty if I wasn't spoiled enough to have 2 good things to compare.
