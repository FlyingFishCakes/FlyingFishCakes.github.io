# Papua New Guinea Roots

## Roast Date: 1-25-2021
8.0 oz -> 6.92 oz (13.5% weight loss)  
I forgot to document the roast, and now I don’t remember. The bag said to either roast very light or 30 second past the second crack, in this roast I roasted it very light.


### Tasting Note on 2-3-2021:
Sweet, milk chocolate, indistinct acidity

The coffee starts off with a slight indistinct acidity that fades quickly followed by a sweet milk chocolate note and a slight tannin finish. Medium body coffee. I may have roasted a tiny bit too lightly because the finish gives a slightly vegetable feeling and I don’t think that the indistinct acidity at the beginning should be quite as pronounced. Bag said to roast light, but would probably be a much more chocolaty medium roast.

### Tasting Note on 2-5-2021:
Sweet, milk chocolate, slight raisins

Tastes much sweeter with less acidity giving off a slight raisin/fruit acidity (remember berry = acidity stronger than sweetness, fruit = sweetness stronger than acidity). Is a much lighter roast despite the impression it gives off with the taste and so by grinding finer was able to taste much better. According to the bag the coffee should taste like cocoa, milk, sweet, smooth - all of which I agree with except for the indistinct acidity (pleasant but fairly light) that is not mentioned.
