# Kicking Horse coffee: Grizzly Claw

## Commercially Roasted Coffee
Bought from Walmart in a 284 gram bag.

## Review (Forgot to do any tasting notes, so this is from memory)
Heavy body, mild sweetness, slight molasses, bitter chocolate

This was roasted very dark with oil visible on the surface of the bean (so a decent amount of time into second crack). Initially I brewed this as espresso and pour over and it kept giving me this unpleasant bitterness reminiscent of tobacco, but then remembered [this link](https://coffeeadastra.com/2019/07/16/why-do-percolation-and-immersion-coffee-taste-so-different/). After switching from percolation methods to immersion methods of brewing coffee the tobacco taste went away replaced by the bitter chocolate flavors I noted above. Again despite the being a long time from the roast date and being stale there were no notes of oxidation until well into the end of the second week.
