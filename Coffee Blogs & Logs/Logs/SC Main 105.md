# Sam's Choice: Main 105 Coffee

## Commercially Roasted Coffee
Bought from Walmart in a 340 gram bag.

## Tasting Notes on 4-9-2021:
Mild acidity, sweet, slight roasty finish, bitter finish

Espresso recipe is 40 grams out, 15 grams in, 6 bar pressure, and 15 second brew time. Tastes pretty good still needs to be dialed in a bit.

## Tasting Notes on 4-10-2021:
Very sweet, tart acidity, honey on the finish

Espresso recipe is 41 grams out, 15 grams in, 6 bar pressure, and one step coarser than yesterday. Roasty/bitter finish is gone now and the espresso is sweet with a mild acidity which is surprising. This is a medium roast so I was expecting a sharper more aggressive acidity. Either this coffee is a little more developed than I thought or it might be the effect of getting stale.

## Tasting Notes on 4-10-2021:
Mildly Sweet, roasty/bitter, no acidity

30 grams in, 500 grams out, V60 pour over. This is probably over extracted, I probably need to lower the brew temp and coarsen the grind size to get rid of the roasty and bitter tastes respectively. Not great.

## Tasting Notes on 4-11-2021:
Mild Sweetness, mild acidity, heavy body

50 grams in, 800 grams out, V60 pour over temperature dropped to 85 Celsius grind coarsened. This is properly extracted and tastes good, but is a little weak (stronger ratio would probably be better). I have run out of this coffee so I guess I won't get another chance to dial in this time.
