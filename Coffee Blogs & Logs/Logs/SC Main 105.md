# Sam's Choice: Main 105 Coffee

## Commercially Roasted Coffee
Bought from Walmart in a 340 gram bag.

## Tasting Notes on 4-9-2021:
Mild acidity, sweet, slight roasty finish, bitter finish

Espresso recipe is 40 grams out, 15 grams in, 6 bar pressure, and 15 second brew time. Tastes pretty good still needs to be dialed in a bit.
