# Sam's Choice: Main 105 Coffee

## Commercially Roasted Coffee
Bought from Walmart in a 340 gram bag.

## Tasting Notes on 4-9-2021:
Mild acidity, sweet, slight roasty finish, bitter finish

Espresso recipe is 40 grams out, 15 grams in, 6 bar pressure, and 15 second brew time. Tastes pretty good still needs to be dialed in a bit.

## Tasting Notes on 4-10-2021:
Very sweet, tart acidity, honey on the finish

Espresso recipe is 41 grams out, 15 grams in, 6 bar pressure, and one step coarser than yesterday. Roasty/bitter finish is gone now and the espresso is sweet with a mild acidity which is surprising. This is a medium roast so I was expecting a sharper more aggressive acidity. Either this coffee is a little more developed than I thought or it might be the effect of getting stale.
