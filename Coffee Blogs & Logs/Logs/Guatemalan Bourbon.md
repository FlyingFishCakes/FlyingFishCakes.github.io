# Guatemalan Bourbon

Bought from smoking beans on Amazon.
Chocolate, milk, and raisins were the descriptors on the bag that I tasted. In more general terms there is a cocoa like bitterness with a bit of acidity underlining a general sweetness. The descriptor milk I believe references the slight fatty and rich aftertaste of the coffee. Works best as a medium roast to a light roast.

## Roast Date 2-11-2021:
350 grams to 304.2 grams (13.09% roast lost)  
21 minute roast  
5 minute drying phase  
12 minute first crack  
21 minute drop

### Tasting Notes on 2-18-2021:
Sweet, slight raisin/dried fruit, slight chocolate, roasty taste, cereal

This was dialed in using a bypass brew of 20 grams to 200 grams of water after which the concentrate was diluted with 50 grams of water. This brew method is not super efficient in terms of extraction I think.

### Tasting Notes on 2-19-2021:
Very sweet, very fruity, slight tanginess, slight roasty aftertaste, slight caramel/honey/raw sugar (kind of indistinct)

This was brewed using a bypass method in which I appropriated the aeropress brew method into my V60 with a 1:15 ratio in which the concentrate was 1:10 ratio pulse pour.

### Tasting Notes on 2-20-201:
Sweet, honey, slight chocolate, clean, medium body, slight acidity (a little fruity?)

This was brewed using a normal 1:15 ratio using my default method. Very tasty, but not as tasty as yesterday’s bypass brew (I’ll try dialing it in some more, because I just don’t believe that the taste can be replicated using my default method).

### Tasting Notes on 2-21-2021:
Sweet, Honey, slight chocolate like bitterness, raisins oranges, very slight tanginess, , very tasty

Same thing as yesterday using a 1:15 ratio using my default method. I got it pretty much dialed in, but for some reason I still can’t get that intense sweetness I got using the bypass method with high agitation. Instead it tastes much more mellow (it’s still sweet that’s for sure). At this point it is probably more a matter of preference than of objective fact.

### Tasting Notes on 2-21-2021:
Sweet, fruity, little nuttiness

Last of the coffee I brewed using the bypass method. Since I just had the normal method earlier today I can confirm for certain that the acidity of this method is enhanced not at the expense of sweet or extraction. The body is definitely thinner but not by much and while the bitterness is still present it is much more indistinct. I am starting to believe that this bypass brew method might exaggerate notes related to acidity while maybe muting notes related to bitterness (still need to test that).

## Roast Date 2-18-2021:
270 grams to 230 grams (14.81% roast lost)  
Didn’t time the roast. I roasted it until I heard the very first instances of second crack so it should be around medium dark roast. After a few days this are very sparse but  visible spots of oil on the coffee beans which suggest that I ended up taking this roast to the very first points of the second crack.

### Tasting Notes on 2-22-2021:
Sweet (not yet molasses like), slight roasty bitterness, chocolate, slight acidity (dried fruit like, very pleasant, raisins?), tasty but not perfect, honey like sweetness, heavier body

I think the water temperature I used to brew this coffee was too high, I can say anything conclusive about this roast. I take it back actually, after the coffee cooled that roasty flavor disappeared and the chocolate flavor became much stronger.

### Tasting Notes on 2-22-2021:
Sweet, very chocolaty, very smooth, no harsh bitterness, very mild acidity (again dried fruit like when combined with the sweetness)

Bypass brew recipe that I am starting to fall back on more and more. Very difficult to mess up and get harsh notes from.

### Tasting Notes on 2-26-2021:
Super smooth, medium body, super chocolaty, sweet, very tasty

I'm still using a flat bottom filter in my V60 right now, but I coarsened up the grind a little bit. Idk why but the drawdown is really slow and I'm getting ~10 minute drawdown times, but for some reason it still tastes great.

## Roast Date 2-27-2021:
250 grams to 211.5 grams (15.4% roast lost)
No recorded roast time, roasted beyond second crack for a dark roast (trying to chase chocolate notes).

### Tasting Notes on 3-3-2021:
Super rich, smooth, super chocolaty, mild pleasant sweetness, very slight smokiness on the finish

I've neglected to some logs on this roast, but this roast is very good. The chocolate notes are very strong, and I absolutely love brewing this with an Ibrik at a 1:8 ratio with or without sugar (transforms into an incredible dessert drink with sugar). I have yet to try adding spices into the Turkish coffee, but the coffee tastes soooooo good. It is just rich, thick bodied, and super chocolaty.

### Tasting Notes on 3-4-2021:
Sweet, chocolaty, slight herbal bitterness, heavy bodied, very tasty

It is an incredibly fascinating change what adding a little cardamom has done. This was brewed in an Ibrik in a 1:1:8 ratio of coffee to sugar to water with 1/8 tsp of cardamom. This would be incredible as a dessert drink. The roast-y bitterness that comes from the crema is now gone because of the cardamom and is now also tasty while adding texture. The bitterness in the coffee has also been replaced with the flavor of cardamom (same concept as espresso tonic). The cardamom does not pair well with this coffee because it masks the coffee intrinsic bitterness. This coffee has a very pleasant chocolate bitterness that I like, but I can see if the coffee was roasted dark with an unpleasant bitterness it might be good to neutralize with the cardamom (or you might just like cardamom, but I like choco more).  

### Tasting Notes on 3-5-2021:
Bitter, slightly sweet, slight acrid taste, slight harshness, chocolaty

1:16 pour over using pulse pour method, but I either ground too fine or brewed too hot. Has distinct notes of over extraction.

### Tasting Notes on 3-6-2021:
Mild sweetness, dried fruit like acidity, chocolate notes, slight roasty taste, very tasty

1:16 pour over using pulse pour, I ground 1 number finer on my JX manual (37.5 microns coarser). I believe the grind is dialed in, but I am still brewing too hot giving the coffee a roasty finish that I don't think should be there. The bitterness is gone though and it still tasty despite not being perfect.

### Tasting Notes on 3-7-2021:
Sweet, dried fruit like acidity (I want to say raisins because that was on the bag, but I actually don't know how to describe it), chocolate notes, very tasty

1:16 pour over using pulse pour, I ground 1/3 number coarser on my JX manual (12.5 microns) and lower the brew temp by a few degree. The coffee is very sweet and offers very mild but pronounced acidity (more than I would expect for a dark roast). This is a good dark roast, very tasty.

## Roast Date 3-7-2021:
250 grams to 211 grams (15.6% weight loss)
Roast not timed, aiming for some crack beyond second crack

### Tasting Notes on 3-10-2021:
Sweet, fruity, vague hint of chocolate, strong

Using Flair espresso to make this coffee as espresso (15 grams in 33 grams out). Not yet used to drinking such concentrated coffee yet, but after dialing in it tastes very fruity and a little bit of chocolate on the finish. I thought I roasted it on the darker side but maybe I need to go even further if I want stronger chocolate notes for espresso (the coffee may also be too fresh, because this is only 3 days off roast).

### Tasting Notes on 3-13-2021:
Sweet, chocolate, pleasant but sharp acidity

Pulling 15 grams in 34 grams out probably need to make it 35 grams out and maybe grind 12.5 microns finer to get rid of the slightly sharp acidity. There is a very pleasant sweetness.

### Tasting Notes on 3-13-2021:
Very Sweet, slight chocolate, pleasant acidity

Tightened up the grind and pulled an extra gram of water through the puck. The espresso is much more balanced now with some bitterness to balance out the acidity, but I think that the grinder might be holding the espresso back because a more unimodal grinder might give more sweetness while dialing back the acidity and bitterness. Still tasty though.

## Roast Date 3-13-2021:
250 grams to 211 grams (15.6% weight loss)
Roast not timed, I wanted to replicate my previous roast but just roast a bit hotter.

### Tasting Notes on 3-20-2021:
Bright acidity, pronounced sweetness, chocolaty finish

Finally dialed in espresso of this new roast; I reduced the dose from 15 grams to 14.5 and pulled 32 grams out with 3 bar preinfusion and 6 bar flat profile to get the best tasting espresso I had since getting the Flair. The reservoir doesn't hold enough water to do a good job extracting more than 15 grams of coffee (unless it is roasted very dark maybe?). After half of the shot I wondered how this coffee would taste as the basis of a milk drink, and it was amazing. After adding milk the acidity, sweetness, and chocolate notes combined together to form very, very strong caramel notes. This coffee would be amazing as the basis of a milk drink, it tasted sweet enough without sugar to stand up the milk.

### Tasting Notes on 3-21-2021:
Bright acidity, strong sweetness, round finish (I think is caused by bitterness even though I can't directly taste it)

14 grams in 30 grams out ground a bit finer. I pulled this shot a little shorter to get a brighter taste, strong sweetness, and minimal bitterness at the highest possible strength at the cost of some extraction. It is a very tasty shot of espresso. I wish I has a cup small enough.

## Roast Date 4-10-2021:
251.2 grams to 218.7 grams (12.9% roast loss)

### Tasting Notes on 4-20-2021:
Tart acidity, honey/berry like sweetness, very sweet, caramel finish, trace of bitterness (spicy?), very tasty

Brewed with a V60. The coffee has a predominant acidity with a very pleasant sweetness. The sweetness tastes berry like combined with the tart acidity. There is also a trace of bitterness reminiscent of that slight bitterness one might perceive with toasted spices and is very pleasant. This is a very lightly roasted coffee and needs to be brewed as hot as possible and with a higher ratio; otherwise it is possible to get very grassy/vegetable flavors and/or a unpalatable acidity.
