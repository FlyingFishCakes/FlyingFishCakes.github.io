Guatemalan Bourbon

Bought from smoking beans on Amazon.
Chocolate, milk, and raisins were the descriptors on the bag that I tasted. In more general terms there is a cocoa like bitterness with a bit of acidity underlining a general sweetness. The descriptor milk I believe references the slight fatty and rich aftertaste of the coffee. Works best as a medium roast to a light roast.

Roast Date 2-11-2021:
350 grams to 304.2 grams (13.09% roast lost)
21 minute roast
5 minute drying phase
12 minute first crack
21 drop

Tasting Notes on 2-18-2021:
Sweet, slight raisin/dried fruit, slight chocolate, roasty taste, cereal

This was dialed in using a bypass brew of 20 grams to 200 grams of water after which the concentrate was diluted with 50 grams of water. This brew method is not super efficient in terms of extraction I think.

Tasting Notes on 2-19-2021:
Very sweet, very fruity, slight tanginess, slight roasty aftertaste, slight caramel/honey/raw sugar (kind of indistinct)

This was brewed using a bypass method in which I appropriated the aeropress brew method into my V60 with a 1:15 ratio in which the concentrate was 1:10 ratio pulse pour.

Tasting Notes on 2-20-201:
Sweet, honey, slight chocolate, clean, medium body, slight acidity (a little fruity?)

This was brewed using a normal 1:15 ratio using my default method. Very tasty, but not as tasty as yesterday’s bypass brew (I’ll try dialing it in some more, because I just don’t believe that the taste can be replicated using my default method).

Tasting Notes on 2-21-2021:
Sweet, Honey, slight chocolate like bitterness, raisins oranges, very slight tanginess, , very tasty

Same thing as yesterday using a 1:15 ratio using my default method. I got it pretty much dialed in, but for some reason I still can’t get that intense sweetness I got using the bypass method with high agitation. Instead it tastes much more mellow (it’s still sweet that’s for sure). At this point it is probably more a matter of preference than of objective fact.
Tasting Notes on 2-21-2021:
Sweet, fruity, little nuttiness

Last of the coffee I brewed using the bypass method. Since I just had the normal method earlier today I can confirm for certain that the acidity of this method is enhanced not at the expense of sweet or extraction. The body is definitely thinner but not by much and while the bitterness is still present it is much more indistinct. I am starting to believe that this bypass brew method might exaggerate notes related to acidity while maybe muting notes related to bitterness (still need to test that).

Roast Date 2-18-2021:
270 grams to 230 grams (14.81% roast lost)
Didn’t time the roast. I roasted it until I heard the very first instances of second crack so it should be around medium dark roast. After a few days this are very sparse but  visible spots of oil on the coffee beans which suggest that I ended up taking this roast to the very first points of the second crack.

Tasting Notes on 2-22-2021:
Sweet (not yet molasses like), slight roasty bitterness, chocolate, slight acidity (dried fruit like, very pleasant, raisins?), tasty but not perfect, honey like sweetness, heavier body

I think the water temperature I used to brew this coffee was too high, I can say anything conclusive about this roast. I take it back actually, after the coffee cooled that roasty flavor disappeared and the chocolate flavor became much stronger.

Tasting Notes on 2-22-2021:
Sweet, very chocolaty, very smooth, no harsh bitterness, very mild acidity (again dried fruit like when combined with the sweetness)

Bypass brew recipe that I am starting to fall back on more and more. Very difficult to mess up and get harsh notes from.

Tasting Notes on 2-26-2021:
Super smooth, medium body, super chocolaty, sweet, very tasty

I'm still using a flat bottom filter in my V60 right now, but I coarsened up the grind a little bit. Idk why but the drawdown is really slow and I'm getting ~10 minute drawdown times, but for some reason it still tastes great.

Roast Date 2-27-2021:
250 grams to 211.5 grams (15.4% roast lost)
No recorded roast time, roasted beyond second crack for a dark roast (trying to chase chocolate notes).
