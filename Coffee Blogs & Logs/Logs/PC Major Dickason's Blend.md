# Peet's Coffee: Major Dickason's Blend


### Tasting Notes on 4-15-2021:
Sweet, molasses, mild roasty/bitter, mildest suggestion of acidity

Very plain, not many characteristics, tastes like the theoretical tasteless dark roast. Brewed with a V60, maybe I under extracted it? I'll try clever dripper, french press, and ibrik next. I don't really like dark roasts coffee without chocolate notes.

Very sweet, slight smoky, slight chocolate on finish, molasses

Brewed with french press and gives a much better taste than earlier today. It taste only slightly better, I should try brewing it as espresso because that is the last thing I can thing of. It tastes very boring, stereotypical dark roast flavors, no characteristics of note.
