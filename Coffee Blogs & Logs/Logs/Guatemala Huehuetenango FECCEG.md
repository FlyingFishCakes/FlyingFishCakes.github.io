# Guatemala Huehuetenango FECCEG

## Roast Date: 1-31-2021
Roast weight not logged because while I was cooling the beans in the colander I dropped some into the snow  
13:45 minute roast (declining ROR)  
4 minute drying phase  
8 minute first crack  
13:30 second crack

Bag says to roast 10 seconds after the second crack begins.

### Tasting Notes on 2-8-2021:
Sweet, slight molasses, slight tobacco, almost no acidity, slight bready/caramelly

On the bag the tasting notes are supposed to be dark, chocolate, nutty, smooth. I got molasses for dark, no chocolate, got bready/caramelly for nutty, and yeah I guess it was smooth. I may have to roast slightly lighter for the chocolate notes to come out, for some coffees if I roast too dark that chocolate notes turns into a tobacco note.

### Tasting Notes on 2-8-2021:
Sweet, slight chocolate, slight tobacco, slight caramel

Brewed using a stronger ratio and was able to get a more chocolate note but not much taste like a generic dark roast, not super interesting.
