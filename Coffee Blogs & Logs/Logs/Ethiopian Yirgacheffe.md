# Ethiopian Yirgacheffe

Bought from smoking beans on Amazon.
Not taking notes live since this was bought, roasted, and drank before beginning of this journal.
From memory it tasted very sweet, floral, and fruity. It benefitted from being roasted lighter and being dropped at the end of the first crack. The goal is to roast as light as possible without the coffee tasting like battery acid and smelling of grass, because right after that it becomes this fruity mellow tea like coffee with a floral aroma.
