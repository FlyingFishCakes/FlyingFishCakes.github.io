# Ethical Bean Coffee: Sweet Espresso

## Commercially Roasted Coffee
Bought from Walmart in a 340 gram bag.

## Review (Forgot to do any tasting notes, so this is from memory)
Slight chocolate note on after taste, very mild acidity, very sweet as espresso (pulled at 1:2 ratio), raisin like sweetness

Medium Dark Roast Coffee works great with espresso, Turkish, and French press brewing methods. A little bit finicky to dial in as a pour over because the coffee is more developed and is easy to over extract. The coffee was stale but had no discernible notes of oxidation when initially opened, but starting developing a slight off taste near the 2 week mark.
