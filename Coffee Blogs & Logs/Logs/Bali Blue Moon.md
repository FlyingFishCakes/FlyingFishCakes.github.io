### Tasting notes on 1-12-2021 (8 days after roast):
Very intense flavors, smoky, molasses, dark chocolate, very sweet, barest hint of tobacco

Brewed at a standard 1:16.66 ratio and would not recommend a stronger ratio from how intense the flavors already are. Very sweet with the molasses flavor that is indicative of a dark roast. The smoky and tobacco taste are very almost unnoticeable, but can be tasted because I am fairly accustomed to drinking french roast coffee. Dark chocolate notes are very pronounced. Very clean but heavy (mouth drying/sticky sensation like after eating a sugary sweet) aftertaste unlike many stale dark roasts that have strong oxidized and tobacco flavors. After cooling it turned into a smooth, viscous, dark chocolate drink, would probably be great with milk.
