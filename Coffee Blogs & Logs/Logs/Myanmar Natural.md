Myanmar Natural

Roast Date: 1-17-2021
8.01 oz before roast -> 6.95 oz after roast (13.23% weight loss)
13:15 minute roast with declining ROR
5 drying phase
11:15 first crack
13:15 drop (15.09% DTR)

Bag recommended 20 seconds out of the first cracks. I chose to increase the time in exchange for a slower roast because I read online that by roasting/developing the roast slower the fruitiness of the roast is more pronounced.

Tasting Notes on 1-24-2021:
Floral, spicy, slightly sweet, vague acidity

Brewed with a 1:18 ratio using a clever dripper to try and enhance characteristics of the coffee. There is a floral smell and a slightly spiced note with  very little sweetness and acidity. As the coffee cools, acidity and sweetness get a little more pronounced and the spice I tasted turns a little bitter and combined with the floral smell is reminiscent of orange peel and pith. May need to try brewing with a stronger ratio to get the honey sweetness described on the bag.

Tasting Notes on 1-25-2021:
Floral, spicy, sweet, berry like acidity

Brewed with a 13:200 recipe. Sweetness is much more pronounced as is the acidity. The acidity is slightly stronger than the sweetness, giving it a berry-like acidity than fruit like (if the sweetness is more pronounced than the acidity). After cooling the spiciness changes back to the orange peel like bitterness and the acidity and sweetness are still toned down in comparison to the floral and bitter notes. If the sweetness and acidity were to be isolated, it would be in between berry-like and fruit-like (stone fruit-like?).

Tasting Notes on 1-26-2021:
Very sweet, orange peel/pith bitterness, floral, honey aftertaste, medium body, fruity sourness

Canâ€™t quite identify the sourness. Coarsened grind because the coffee is a little more developed than I previously thought. Sweetness and sourness is now very pronounced with toned back orange peel/pith bitterness and floral notes. Sweetness has a slight honey aftertaste (does not actually taste like honey despite bag descriptions). Has body and sits a little heavier on the tongue.

Tasting Notes on 1-29-2021:
Chocolaty, smooth, full bodied, raisins, indistinct bitterness

Osmotic flow used for the first time offering a very different flavor profile. It tastes much more similar to a flat bottom brewer. The bitterness has lost a lot of its characteristics, and the floral notes that originally combined with the bitterness to give the orange peel impression are significantly toned down.

Fruity, bright, sweet, tiny bit of bitterness, cocoa

Brewed regularly to compare to the osmotic flow. Taste is very different, but after tasting them side by side I believe that I can recreate the same flavor in the osmotic flow by grinding coarser. I believe the difference in taste might have something to do with the slower flow rate of the osmotic flow method.
