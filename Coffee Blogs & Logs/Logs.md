Ethiopian Dumerso

Roast Date: 12-28-2020
8 oz batch before roast -> 7.3 oz batch after roast (8.75% weight loss)
8 minute roast with DTR of 20% (declining ROR observed)
4 minute drying phase
6 minute first crack
8 minute drop

Tasting notes on 1-2-2021 (5 days after roast):
Weak, watery, off-taste, citrus after-taste, sweet, off-smell

The aforementioned off-taste smells and tastes a bit like boiled vegetables. Tasted predominantly sweet with very little acidity, most likely because it needs more time to degas it was roasted pretty light.

Tasting notes on 1-4-2021 (7 days after roast):
Stronger than before but still tea like, acidity more pronounced reminiscent of stone fruit, off-taste and off-smell gone, very sweet

After waiting another 2 days to degas the boiled vegetable smell and taste are gone. May benefit from more time to degas (according to a published study 2-12 days may be needed to proper degas). Since this was roasted very lightly it may need a full 12 days to degas properly.

Tasting notes on 1-6-2021 (10 days after roast):
Stronger taste, very sweet, touch of acidity, floral notes pronounced, citrus notes vague

May have to try with a paper filter because that usually increases acidity while cloth filter increases aroma of coffee. Still peach-like sweetness as a result of a combination of floral smell, sweet taste, and underlying acidity that tapers off like orange fruit juice.

Tasting notes on 1-11-2021 (15 days after roast):
Very sweet, very strong fruit flavors, touch of acidity, super tasty

It Tasted like fruit juice compared to other coffees that I have had. It is very tasty.


Bali Blue Moon

Roast Date: 1-4-2021
230 grams before roast -> 191 grams after roast (16.96% weight loss)
12 minute roast (decline ROR not observed)
4 minute drying phase
8 minute first crack
11:30 minute second crack
12 minute drop

Tasting notes on 1-12-2021 (8 days after roast):
Very intense flavors, smoky, molasses, dark chocolate, very sweet, barest hint of tobacco

Brewed at a standard 1:16.66 ratio and would not recommend a stronger ratio from how intense the flavors already are. Very sweet with the molasses flavor that is indicative of a dark roast. The smoky and tobacco taste are very almost unnoticeable, but can be tasted because I am fairly accustomed to drinking french roast coffee. Dark chocolate notes are very pronounced. Very clean but heavy (mouth drying/sticky sensation like after eating a sugary sweet) aftertaste unlike many stale dark roasts that have strong oxidized and tobacco flavors. After cooling it turned into a smooth, viscous, dark chocolate drink, would probably be great with milk.


Myanmar Natural

Roast Date: 1-17-2021
8.01 oz before roast -> 6.95 oz after roast (13.23% weight loss)
13:15 minute roast with declining ROR
5 drying phase
11:15 first crack
13:15 drop (15.09% DTR)

Bag recommended 20 seconds out of the first cracks. I chose to increase the time in exchange for a slower roast because I read online that by roasting/developing the roast slower the fruitiness of the roast is more pronounced.

Tasting Notes on 1-24-2021:
Floral, spicy, slightly sweet, vague acidity

Brewed with a 1:18 ratio using a clever dripper to try and enhance characteristics of the coffee. There is a floral smell and a slightly spiced note with  very little sweetness and acidity. As the coffee cools, acidity and sweetness get a little more pronounced and the spice I tasted turns a little bitter and combined with the floral smell is reminiscent of orange peel and pith. May need to try brewing with a stronger ratio to get the honey sweetness described on the bag.

Tasting Notes on 1-25-2021:
Floral, spicy, sweet, berry like acidity

Brewed with a 13:200 recipe. Sweetness is much more pronounced as is the acidity. The acidity is slightly stronger than the sweetness, giving it a berry-like acidity than fruit like (if the sweetness is more pronounced than the acidity). After cooling the spiciness changes back to the orange peel like bitterness and the acidity and sweetness are still toned down in comparison to the floral and bitter notes. If the sweetness and acidity were to be isolated, it would be in between berry-like and fruit-like (stone fruit-like?).

Tasting Notes on 1-26-2021:
Very sweet, orange peel/pith bitterness, floral, honey aftertaste, medium body, fruity sourness

Can’t quite identify the sourness. Coarsened grind because the coffee is a little more developed than I previously thought. Sweetness and sourness is now very pronounced with toned back orange peel/pith bitterness and floral notes. Sweetness has a slight honey aftertaste (does not actually taste like honey despite bag descriptions). Has body and sits a little heavier on the tongue.

Tasting Notes on 1-29-2021:
Chocolaty, smooth, full bodied, raisins, indistinct bitterness

Osmotic flow used for the first time offering a very different flavor profile. It tastes much more similar to a flat bottom brewer. The bitterness has lost a lot of its characteristics, and the floral notes that originally combined with the bitterness to give the orange peel impression are significantly toned down.

Fruity, bright, sweet, tiny bit of bitterness, cocoa

Brewed regularly to compare to the osmotic flow. Taste is very different, but after tasting them side by side I believe that I can recreate the same flavor in the osmotic flow by grinding coarser. I believe the difference in taste might have something to do with the slower flow rate of the osmotic flow method.
Colombia Santa Barbara

Roast Date: 1-21-2021
8.0 oz before roast -> 6.84 oz after roast (14.5% weight loss)
25 minute roast with declining ROR
8 minute drying phase
14 minute first crack
25 minute second crack
25 minute drop
Was supposed to bring close to second crack but because of temperature dropping during the middle of roasting, time was dragged out.

Tasting Notes on 1-30-2021:
Medium body, sweet, slight molasses, slight smoky, raisins

Fairly indistinct medium dark roast with notes of raisins/figs with notes of molasses characteristic of a darker roast. Oddly enough no discernible notes of nuts or cocoa present in many other coffees. After taking a look at the bag I found out that I nailed the tasting notes on the head (raisin, brown sugar, fig, newton - definitely didn’t taste any). Next time I roast this I should dial it a bit light because the brown sugar/molasses notes have a slight aftertaste of tobacco indicating that it is slightly darker than I would consider ideal. May try Osmotic flow brew method to exaggerate dark roast characteristics.

Tasting Notes on 1-30-2021:
Heavy body, sweet, molasses, slightly smoky/musky, raisins

This time brewed with the Osmotic flow method. The difference is subtle but present compared to yesterday. Body is a bit heavier and the taste + sweetness of the molasses is stronger, but acidity is less pronounced lowering the raisin character.

Tasting Notes on 1-31-2021:
Sweet, molasses, roasty, slight tobacco

Used stronger ratio, taste is slightly better. Still slight tobacco taste

Tasting Notes on 2-1-2021:
Sweet, raisins, slight molasses

Used a normal 60 grams per liter ratio with heavy agitation, the tobacco flavor is gone and is very sweet with molasses and raisins. Previous conception was wrong, osmotic flow is bad, either uneven extraction (caused by little agitation) or lower brew temp is bringing out the slight tobacco flavor and is making the coffee taste bad. I’m getting more confused when osmotic flow is good or if it is even good at all. The first percolation phase of the Osmotic flow method only percolates through a small amount of the grounds with the rest of the coffee above the water line and we know that percolation is stronger than immersion causing uneven extraction. Osmotic flow method might have to be modified to work better.
Guatemala Huehuetenango FECCEG
Roast Date: 1-31-2021
Roast weight not logged because while I was cooling the beans in the colander I dropped some into the snow
13:45 minute roast (declining ROR)
4 minute drying phase
8 minute first crack
13:30 second crack

Bag says to roast 10 seconds after the second crack begins.

Tasting Notes on 2-8-2021:
Sweet, slight molasses, slight tobacco, almost no acidity, slight bready/caramelly

On the bag the tasting notes are supposed to be dark, chocolate, nutty, smooth. I got molasses for dark, no chocolate, got bready/caramelly for nutty, and yeah I guess it was smooth. I may have to roast slightly lighter for the chocolate notes to come out, for some coffees if I roast too dark that chocolate notes turns into a tobacco note.

Tasting Notes on 2-8-2021:
Sweet, slight chocolate, slight tobacco, slight caramel

Brewed using a stronger ratio and was able to get a more chocolate note but not much taste like a generic dark roast, not super interesting.
Honduras Santa Elena

Roast Date: 1-14-2021
8.01 oz before roast -> 7.1 oz after roast (11.36% weight loss)
8:30 minute roast (declining ROR observed)
5 minute first crack
8:30 drop (41.18% DTR)

Bag said to roast as close to second crack as possible, if it does not taste good I will try to roast to 25% DTR with declining ROR.

Tasting notes on 1-21-2021 (7 days after roast):
Sweet, tea like, slight vegetable on the finish, chocolate

May be under roasted. Very hard time grinding the beans, and behaved like a light roast. The beans are very dense and may need to roast hotter next time.

Testing reroasting of beans:
160 gram before roast -> 156 gram after roast (2.5% weight loss)
4:30 roast time

It is behaving very differently after roasting. The flavor is much stronger and better tasting now, with some more notes of chocolate, but acidity has been muted. The coffee is also behaving differently in that the bloom and off-gassing is much less intense meaning that the gasses inside the bean escaped somehow, while no new gasses were formed during the second roast. It may be plausible that roasting a large batch of coffee beans very lightly before cold storage to roast small batches prior to use might be a thing you could do (I don’t know why, but it is something you could do).

Tasting notes on 1-23-2021:
Cocoa, raisins, light sweetness, low body, no floral, fruity acidity
14:15 minute roast (declining ROR)
5 minute dry phase
12 minute first crack
14:15 drop (15.79% DTR)

Bag said to roast 15 seconds after first cracks. Tasting notes on the bag said cocoa, milk,etc.
Papua New Guinea Roots

Roast Date: 1-25-2021
8.0 oz -> 6.92 oz (13.5% weight loss)
I forgot to document the roast, and now I don’t remember. The bag said to either roast very light or 30 second past the second crack, in this roast I roasted it very light.


Tasting Note on 2-3-2021:
Sweet, milk chocolate, indistinct acidity

The coffee starts off with a slight indistinct acidity that fades quickly followed by a sweet milk chocolate note and a slight tannin finish. Medium body coffee. I may have roasted a tiny bit too lightly because the finish gives a slightly vegetable feeling and I don’t think that the indistinct acidity at the beginning should be quite as pronounced. Bag said to roast light, but would probably be a much more chocolaty medium roast.

Tasting Note on 2-5-2021:
Sweet, milk chocolate, slight raisins

Tastes much sweeter with less acidity giving off a slight raisin/fruit acidity (remember berry = acidity stronger than sweetness, fruit = sweetness stronger than acidity). Is a much lighter roast despite the impression it gives off with the taste and so by grinding finer was able to taste much better. According to the bag the coffee should taste like cocoa, milk, sweet, smooth - all of which I agree with except for the indistinct acidity (pleasant but fairly light) that is not mentioned.
Guatemalan Bourbon

Bought from smoking beans on Amazon.
Chocolate, milk, and raisins were the descriptors on the bag that I tasted. In more general terms there is a cocoa like bitterness with a bit of acidity underlining a general sweetness. The descriptor milk I believe references the slight fatty and rich aftertaste of the coffee. Works best as a medium roast to a light roast.

Roast Date 2-11-2021:
350 grams to 304.2 grams (13.09% roast lost)
21 minute roast
5 minute drying phase
12 minute first crack
21 drop

Tasting Notes on 2-18-2021:
Sweet, slight raisin/dried fruit, slight chocolate, roasty taste, cereal

This was dialed in using a bypass brew of 20 grams to 200 grams of water after which the concentrate was diluted with 50 grams of water. This brew method is not super efficient in terms of extraction I think.

Tasting Notes on 2-19-2021:
Very sweet, very fruity, slight tanginess, slight roasty aftertaste, slight caramel/honey/raw sugar (kind of indistinct)

This was brewed using a bypass method in which I appropriated the aeropress brew method into my V60 with a 1:15 ratio in which the concentrate was 1:10 ratio pulse pour.

Tasting Notes on 2-20-201:
Sweet, honey, slight chocolate, clean, medium body, slight acidity (a little fruity?)

This was brewed using a normal 1:15 ratio using my default method. Very tasty, but not as tasty as yesterday’s bypass brew (I’ll try dialing it in some more, because I just don’t believe that the taste can be replicated using my default method).

Tasting Notes on 2-21-2021:
Sweet, Honey, slight chocolate like bitterness, raisins oranges, very slight tanginess, , very tasty

Same thing as yesterday using a 1:15 ratio using my default method. I got it pretty much dialed in, but for some reason I still can’t get that intense sweetness I got using the bypass method with high agitation. Instead it tastes much more mellow (it’s still sweet that’s for sure). At this point it is probably more a matter of preference than of objective fact.
Tasting Notes on 2-21-2021:
Sweet, fruity, little nuttiness

Last of the coffee I brewed using the bypass method. Since I just had the normal method earlier today I can confirm for certain that the acidity of this method is enhanced not at the expense of sweet or extraction. The body is definitely thinner but not by much and while the bitterness is still present it is much more indistinct. I am starting to believe that this bypass brew method might exaggerate notes related to acidity while maybe muting notes related to bitterness (still need to test that).

Roast Date 2-18-2021:
270 grams to 230 grams (14.81% roast lost)
Didn’t time the roast. I roasted it until I heard the very first instances of second crack so it should be around medium dark roast. After a few days this are very sparse but  visible spots of oil on the coffee beans which suggest that I ended up taking this roast to the very first points of the second crack.

Tasting Notes on 2-22-2021:
Sweet (not yet molasses like), slight roasty bitterness, chocolate, slight acidity (dried fruit like, very pleasant, raisins?), tasty but not perfect, honey like sweetness, heavier body

I think the water temperature I used to brew this coffee was too high, I can say anything conclusive about this roast. I take it back actually, after the coffee cooled that roasty flavor disappeared and the chocolate flavor became much stronger.

Tasting Notes on 2-22-2021:
Sweet, very chocolaty, very smooth, no harsh bitterness, very mild acidity (again dried fruit like when combined with the sweetness)

Bypass brew recipe that I am starting to fall back on more and more. Very difficult to mess up and get harsh notes from.
Ethiopian Yirgacheffe

Bought from smoking beans on Amazon.
Not taking notes live since this was bought, roasted, and drank before beginning of this journal.
From memory it tasted very sweet, floral, and fruity. It benefitted from being roasted lighter and being dropped at the end of the first crack. The goal is to roast as light as possible without the coffee tasting like battery acid and smelling of grass, because right after that it becomes this fruity mellow tea like coffee with a floral aroma.

Starbucks French Roast
I always have access to a bag of Starbucks French roast because it is my parents favorite coffee. It always reminds me of heavy molasses and tobacco, and if brewed perfectly you can limit the tobacco taste and is a terrific base for a milk drink. Whenever I am experimenting with different brewing methods I like to try and dial in a cup of this coffee, because it is incredibly easy to over-extract. As of now the only times I have ever made a less-offensive cup of this coffee is with a french press and clever dripper.

Tasting Notes on 1-19-2021:
Musty, bitter, tobacco, overpowering

Brewed with the bypass brewing method to see if I could combat over extraction, but it just tastes plain bad. I wonder if this is actually under extracted since I didn’t agitate it, but it still tastes so strong for some reason.

Tasting Notes on 1-20-2021:
Bitter, molasses, weak bodied

Brewed with a bypass method and significantly reduced the brewing temperature from boiling to 180 fahrenheit. Still not good but less offensive, still doesn’t compare to immersion brews of this coffee.
