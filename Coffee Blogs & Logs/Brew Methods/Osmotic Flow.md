## Osmotic Flow
I do a modified osmotic flow, not the osmotic flow shown on Cafecs website:

Instead, when you are supposed to begin doing slow concentric circles I do larger circles and I keep the water level low to have the bed as flat as possible after drawdown.

### Main Takeaways
Bed prep is important (I stir the dry grounds to make sure there are no clumps)
Agitation is beneficial, but not necessary (I was able to change the flavor profile of a coffee bean with it still tasting good, refer to myanmar natural)
If you need more precise pouring from you gooseneck kettle, do not fill it as full so you can get a straight drop of water
Using a V60 it tasted much more like a flat bottom brewer than a cone shaped brewer (see Coffee Science), so may be better to use this technique for darker roasts (suddenly craving a super chocolaty dark roast now).
Would probably be a waste to use on lighter roasts with fruitier flavors. It would still make a good cup but would mute the special characteristics of the coffee.
### Addendum
I tried brewing some french roast coffee that my dad likes and I think I realized why this brew method exists. For some reason the coffee always floats even if I try to agitate as much as I can during the bloom. This method might have come into existence because of a combination of roasting well past the second crack and stale coffee or on the flip side maybe coffee what was roasted very dark and too fresh.
