# Osmotic Flow
A brew method in which you:
* Bloom with just enough water to saturate the surface of the coffee bed
* Pour into the center of the coffee bed for around 1/3 of the brew water
* Slowly pour in a circular motion out from the center without ever pouring on the filter for the rest of the brew
* Let it drawdown and you're done

## Main Takeaways
* Idk I haven't gotten good results with this yet, maybe just not dialed in?
 * I'm thinking that it might require a much coarser grind, slow flow of water, and larger batch
 * I think Coffee Chronicler's video of this method might be the best one to learn from
