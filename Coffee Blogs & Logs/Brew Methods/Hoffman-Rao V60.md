## Hoffman/Rao V60
Fairly consistent and repeatable with only grind size to dial in.

### Main Takeaways
* Fill the cone up high to maintain temperature
* Stir at the end to knock down coffee stuck to the walls of the brewer
* Swirl the bloom instead of stirring - this only works with better grinders that donâ€™t generate large amounts of fines
