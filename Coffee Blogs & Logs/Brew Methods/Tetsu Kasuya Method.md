# 4/6 Tetsu Kasuya Method
Pulse pour method in which you grind very coarse and divide the total brew water into multiple pours within a 40% to 60% framework where the first 40% brew water controls acidity and sweetness. The secondary 60% of brew water controls brew strength. Interestingly, there is little mention of over extraction because of how difficult it is to actually over extract. Remember that the coarser the grind the harder it is to over extract a pour over both because of reduced surface area and a faster flow of water through the coffee bed (the water temperature also doesnâ€™t stay as hot because of the smaller thermal mass in the slurry). This tendency to under extract is balanced by the pulse pours which slow the drawdown. The result is a brew method that makes medium to dark roasts really pop while giving really light roasts a slight grassy/green taste (I think the slurry is just not hot enough in this pulse pour method).

## The Theory
* The first 40% adjusts the sweetness and acidity because the first pulse also doubles as the bloom in which adding more water while the coffee is still off gassing will under extract the coffee giving more acidity.
* The second pour during the first 40% is said to give more sweetness, but I believe that is just because most of the extraction in a pour over occurs in the first minute after the bloom pour.
* The number of pours in the final 60% adjusts strength and body because the more water in a pulse the faster it draws down (remember the coarse grind?) giving less contact time

## Main Takeaways
* Coarse grind helps maintain an even coffee bed
* Keep low slurry to reduce brew temperature
* Keep low slurry to increase contact time
* Works wonderfully for medium to dark roasts (light roast tend to get under extracted)
* My theory is that with lighter roasts, water temperature and grind size is more important than brew time
* Easier to under extract than over extract, so try to keep your kettle as hot as possible
* Adjust pulse pour amounts in the first 40% to either increase acidity or sweetness
 * Larger first pour to increase acidity, Larger second pour to increase sweetness
* Adjust pulse pour amounts in the second 60% to adjust body and strength
 * Fewer pours to reduce strength and body, more pours to increase strength and body
