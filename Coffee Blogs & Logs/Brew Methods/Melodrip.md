# Melodrip
Definitely did not buy a piece of plastic with holes in it. I fashioned an approximation with a paper coffee cup with holes poked into the bottom. It definitely helped with the gently distributing the water so the coffee bed was not disturbed. The biggest difference though was probably the multiple pulse pours at the beginning that did a great job of degassing the grounds and prepping an evenly saturated coffee bed.

## Main Takeaways
* Multiple pulse pours to bloom including agitation is very effective
* Not disturbing the coffee bed can be achieved with a careful pour
* Melodrip is convenient but not crucial to break the fall of water into the coffee bed (pouring slowly around the edges of the cone has a similar effect)
* Very consistent brew method in which the only variable is the grind size
