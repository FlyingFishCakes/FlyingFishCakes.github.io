# Tips for Evaluating Coffee
Smell, taste, and touch make up our perception of coffee. Combinations of smell, sweetness, acidity, bitterness and texture make up the traits that people use to describe coffee. These are just some helpful tips to get a clearer picture of what is in the cup.
## Smell
* Leave a little bit coffee to dry in a glass/mug/cup
* Smell of crust breaking in cupping
* Smell of coffee in a cup  
## Taste
* Taste when at regular drinking temperature
* Taste when cooled: sweetness, acidity, bitterness, and texture in coffee better when cooled
