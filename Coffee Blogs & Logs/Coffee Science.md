Coffee Science
These are other people's articles, research, and experiments that I aggregate so I have a centralized place to refer to.
Immersion vs Percolation
https://coffeeadastra.com/2019/07/16/why-do-percolation-and-immersion-coffee-taste-so-different/

Simply summed up as an immersion taste profile will be different from percolation because of compound dissolving rate. Faster dissolving compounds are more represented in percolation while immersion represents compounds by the quantity available in the bean.

Percolation has the added variable relation between particle size (or surface area) and contact time.

Flat vs Cone Shaped Percolation Brewer
https://scanews.coffee/25-magazine/issue-8/english/flat-vs-cone-basket-shape-is-as-important-as-grind-size-in-drip-brew-coffee-25-magazine-issue-8/

Simply summed up as:
Flat bottom brewer = dried fruit, sweet, and floral flavor | chocolate, cocoa, and woody flavors
Cone shaped brewer = citrus, berry, and sour | bitterness

Havenâ€™t been able to personally recreate this because I always feel like words are being put into my head after reading this paper. There is a perceptible difference though.
World Coffee Research Sensory Lexicon
https://worldcoffeeresearch.org/work/sensory-lexicon/

Built to be impartial and objective, but as we know nothing ever is. Still a good reference though. A lot of the references for the specific taste and descriptors reference specific brand products probably for consistency, but is something consumers would probably not look at when reading descriptors off a bag. If you are curious though, you can train your palate to taste specific flavors with preparations in the lexicon.
